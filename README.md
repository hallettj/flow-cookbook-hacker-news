Example script to demonstrate type-checking API data with Flow.
This is example code from the article
[Flow Cookbook: Unpacking JSON API data](http://sitr.us/2016/12/20/flow-cookbook-unpacking-json.html).

Source code is in [`index.js.flow`][./index.js.flow].
Read that instead of `index.js`, which is generated by Babel.

Install project dependencies before running the code or running the type checker:

    npm install

To run the code:

    npm run demo

To run Flow type-checking:

    npm run flow
