# source file is important when working with Flow: during type-checking Flow
# will look in npm packages for `.js.flow` files to find type definitions. So
# putting `.js` and `.js.flow` files side-by-side is how you export type
# definitions from a shared library.

# Compute the list of type-definition source files that we want to end up with.
# This is done by replacing the `.js` extension from every value in the
# `transpiled_files` list with a `.js.flow` extension.
